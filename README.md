# Wildfire-Detection

#How to Run
Download dataset (254p Frame Pairs.zip (8.30 GB)) from https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/flame-2-fire-detection-and-modeling-aerial-multi-spectral-image-dataset
Place the data folders (254p Thermal Images and 254p RGB Images) at the same work path with your code.
Install required package by pip install -r requirements.txt
run  rename.py. This makes the paired images have the same name.
Then you can run the train.py to train the model. You can run it by command.
